# Bitcoin-Data-Analysis-and-Price-Forecasting
Analysed, plotted, and forecasted the Bitcoin data set based on Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in Python.

## Motivation 
Forecasting is required in many situations: deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next five years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements. Forecasts can be required several years in advance (for the case of capital investments), or only a few minutes beforehand (for telecommunication routing). Whatever the circumstances or time horizons involved, forecasting is an important aid to effective and efficient planning.

The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:

* how well we understand the factors that contribute to it
* how much data is available
* how similar the future is to the past
* whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast
In this project, I've tried to try to explain that the difference between a random fluctuation in the past data that should be ignored, and a genuine pattern should be modelled and extrapolated.


## Types of Forecasting

* **Short-term forecasts** are needed for the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.
* **Medium-term forecasts** are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.
* **Long-term forecasts** are used in strategic planning. Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.

## Determining what to forecast?

In the early stages of a forecasting project, decisions need to be made about what should be forecast. For example, if forecasts are required for items in a manufacturing environment, it is necessary to ask whether forecasts are needed for:

* Every product line, or for groups of products?

* Every sales outlet, or for outlets grouped by region, or only for total sales?weekly data, monthly data or annual data?

* It is also necessary to consider the forecasting horizon. Will forecasts be required for one month in advance, for 6 months, or for ten years? Different types of models will be necessary, depending on what forecast horizon is most important.

* How frequently are forecasts required? Forecasts that need to be produced frequently are better done using an automated system than with methods that require careful manual work.

It is worth spending time talking to the people who will use the forecasts to ensure that you understand their needs, and how the forecasts are to be used, before embarking on extensive work in producing the forecasts.



The appropriate forecasting methods depend largely on what data are available.

If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then qualitative forecasting methods must be used. 

Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:
1. Numerical information about the past is available
2. It is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future. 

There is a wide range of quantitative forecasting methods, often developed within specific disciplines for specific purposes. Each method has its own properties, accuracies, and costs that must be considered when choosing a specific method.

Most quantitative prediction problems use either time series data (collected at regular intervals over time) or cross-sectional data (collected at a single point in time).
